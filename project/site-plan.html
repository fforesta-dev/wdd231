            <h2>1. Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Site Name:</strong> The Plan of Salvation: Our Eternal Journey</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reason for this name:</strong>
                This name is both spiritual and doctrinal, clearly identifying the website’s focus on the
                Plan of Salvation while adding an uplifting, engaging tone with the phrase “Our Eternal
                Journey.” It reflects the idea that each person is progressing along a divine path planned
                by a loving Heavenly Father, making the site inviting for members, new converts, youth,
                and anyone learning about the restored gospel.
            </p>

        <section id="site-purpose">
            <h2>2. Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                “The Plan of Salvation: Our Eternal Journey” is an interactive and educational website
                designed to help visitors understand God’s eternal plan in a clear and uplifting way. The site
                presents step-by-step explanations, visual diagrams, scriptures, and short reflections that
                guide learners through each part of the Plan of Salvation. The goal is to provide a spiritually
                meaningful resource that teaches doctrine while inviting personal reflection on our eternal
                journey back to God.
            </p>
            <p>
                This three-page website will present an interactive and educational overview of the
                Plan of Salvation. It will include clear explanations, visual diagrams, and user-friendly
                sections that help visitors understand the doctrine step-by-step.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain each part of the Plan of Salvation in simple, accessible language.</li>
                <li>Provide a visual diagram of the plan to support different learning styles.</li>
                <li>Include scripture references and quotations from modern prophets.</li>
                <li>Offer short interactive elements such as a modal dialog with extra insights.</li>
                <li>Use JSON data to load and display key principles (for example, stages of the plan with titles, short
                    descriptions, and scriptures).</li>
                <li>Invite visitors to reflect on what the Plan of Salvation means personally through a small form or
                    prompt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The goal is to provide an engaging learning resource that is accessible on all devices,
                visually uplifting, and spiritually focused.

            <h2>3. Project Reason and Personal Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this subject because I want to create something meaningful that aligns with my
                faith, my mission service, and my desire to help others understand gospel principles in
                a simple way. This topic motivates me personally, and I already have ideas, scriptures,
                and content that will allow me to build a complete and authentic website without
                placeholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating this site will also strengthen my frontend development skills by combining
                design, accessibility, and dynamic functionality with something spiritually valuable.
                It lets me practice planning, responsive layout, modals, JSON data, and forms while
                building a website that I would actually want to share in a church or study context.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scenario 2:</strong>

                    or family member about the Plan of Salvation?”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scenario 3:</strong>
